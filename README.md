This assignment involves refactoring a codebase to make it more efficient and semantically correct.
The codebase was written in HTML and CSS, various parts were inspected and modified. The title of the page was changed. Some HTML tags were slightly modified to ensure there was a logical flow of semantics.
Anchor tags were added where necessary to make the links work.
Alt tags were added to the images.
Repetitive CSS elements were condensed in order to clean up and simplify the codebase.
