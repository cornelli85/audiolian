This assignment involves refactoring a codebase to make it more efficient and semantically correct.
The codebase was written in HTML and CSS.
The title was changed, some HTML tags were changed to allow a better flow of semantic tags.
Anchor tags were added where necessary to make the links work.
Alt tags were added in the images.
Repetitive CSS elements were condensed in order to simplify the codebase.
